CHANGES
=======

-   Overall
    +   Restructured module to use subdirectories per topic (e.g. 'math') instead of single files.
    +   Implemented python3 styles into all files, with backwards compatibility.
-   CHANGES.rst [new-file]
    +   Track changes.
-   MANIFEST.in [new-file]
    +   Track files required for module.
-   version.py  [new-file]
    +   Current version information.  Should be expanded to include git commit SHA, etc.
-   math/
    +   math_core.py
        -   Enhanced the `spline` function, and removed the secondary functions `logSpline` and
            `logSpline_resample`.  The former is included in the new functionality of `spline`,
            and the latter is too simple to warrant its own function.
        -   `strArray [new-function]
            +   Creates a string representation of a numerical array.
        -   `indsWIthin` [new-function]
            +   Finds the indices of an array within the bounds of the given extrema.
        -   `midpoints`
            +   Enhanced to find the midpoints along an arbitrary axis.
-   plot/
    +   plot_core.py
        -   `legend` [new-method]
            +   Similar to 'text' --- just a wrapper for `matplotlib.pyplot.legend`.
        -   `plotConfFill` [new-method]
            +    Draws a median line and filled-regions for associated confidence intervals
                 (e.g. generated by `zcode.math.confidenceIntervals`).
    +   Hist2D.py
        -   Plotted histograms now use the `scipy.stats.binned_statistic` function so that more
            complicated statistics can be used.  The projected histograms are now colored to match
            the 2D main histogram.
